# Python-Image-Manipulation
A Python script using the subprocess library that utilizes calls to a variety of programming files including C, Haskell, and Python. An image is read as an array of unsigned integers, and this array is passed as an argument via the command line to each of the programs. Every program for each of the three languages will display a new output file with its own manipulation of the image.
